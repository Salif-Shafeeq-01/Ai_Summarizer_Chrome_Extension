# Ai_Summarizer_Chrome_Extension
This is a Chrome extension that leverages Google Gemini AI to intelligently generate summaries of any article or web page you visit. Designed to enhance productivity and save time, this tool allows you to quickly grasp the key points of lengthy web content — whether it's a blog post, news article, or documentation.

When you click the extension, it automatically extracts the main textual content from the current page using smart DOM logic and sends it to Google's Gemini API. Based on your selected summary style — Brief, Detailed, or Bullet Points — it returns a concise and meaningful summary generated by AI.

The interface is simple and intuitive. Once the summary is displayed, you can copy it with one click and use it wherever you need — for note-taking, studying, content repurposing, or quick reading.
